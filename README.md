This package is a work in progress providing the necessary tools to work with arbitrary dual `MultiVector`s with optional origin. Full `MultiVector` types are not utilized unless necessary. For example, an operation on two blades may result in another blade type instead of a full `MultiVector` type. Both static and mutable vector types are supported.

### Requirements

This requires my forked version of `ComputedFieldTypes` at https://github.com/chakravala/ComputedFieldTypes.jl

## Usage

Let `N` be the dimension of a `VectorSpace{N}`. The metric `Signature{N}` of the `Basis{N,1}` elements of a `VectorSpace` can be specified with the `V"..."` constructor by using `+` and `-` to specify whether the `Basis{N,1}` element of the corresponding index squares to `+1` or `-1`.
For example, `V"+++"` constructs the signature of a positive definite 3-dimensional `VectorSspace`.
To get dual numbers, it is also possible to specify a degenerate `Basis` element with `ϵ` (having property `eϵ*eϵ=0`) at the first index, i.e. `V"ϵ+++"`.
Optionally, the following `Basis` element can be specified as the origin by using `o` instead, i.e. `V"o+++"` or `V"ϵo+++"`.
These two basis elements will be treated in a special way, such that their values will be invariant under transformations combining `Algebra`s of different dimensions (provided the `Signature` is compatible).
The `Dimension{N}` of the `Algebra` corresponds to the total number of `Basis{N,1}` vectors, but even though `V"ϵo+++"` of type `VectorSpace{5,1,1}` has 5 `Basis{5,1}` elements, it can be internally recognized as being generated by a `3`-dimensional `VectorSpace{3,0,0}` due to the encoding of the degenerate `Basis` element with `D` and origin with `O` in the `VectorSpace{N,D,O}` type.
By virtue of julia's multiple dispatch on the field type `T`, methods can specialize on the `Dimension{N}` and `Grade{G}` and `VectorSpace{N,D,O}` via the algebra's types, as well as `Basis{N,G}`, `SValue{N,G,T}`, `MValue{N,G,T}`, `SBlade{T,N,G}`, `MBlade{T,N,G}`, `MultiVector{T,N}`, and `MultiGrade{N}` types.

The elements of the `Algebra` can currently be generated using the `Basis` elements created by the `@basis` macro,
```Julia
julia> using Grassmann; @basis e V "ϵ+++"
(ϵ+++, e, eϵ, e₁, e₂, e₃, eϵ₁, eϵ₂, eϵ₃, e₁₂, e₁₃, e₂₃, eϵ₁₂, eϵ₁₃, eϵ₂₃, e₁₂₃, eϵ₁₂₃)
```
As a result of this macro, all of the `Basis{N,G}` elements with that `Signature` become available in the local workspace with the specified naming.
The first argument provides the prefix of the `Basis` names, the second argument is the variable name for the `VectorSpace`, and the third argument is the `Signature` specification. Thus,
```Julia
julia> V
ϵ+++

julia> typeof(V)
VectorSpace{4,1,0}

julia> typeof(e13)
Basis{4,2}

julia> e13*e2
-1e₁₂₃

julia> ans * eϵ
1eϵ₁₂₃

julia> ans * eϵ
0e
```
It is entirely possible to assign multiple different bases with different `Signature`s without any problems.
```Julia
julia> @basis b S "++++";

julia> let k = (b1+b2)-b3
           for j ∈ 1:9
               k = k*(b234+b134)
               println(k)
       end end
0 + 1e₁₄ + 1e₂₄ + 2e₃₄
0 - 2e₁ - 2e₂ + 2e₃
0 - 2e₁₄ - 2e₂₄ - 4e₃₄
0 + 4e₁ + 4e₂ - 4e₃
0 + 4e₁₄ + 4e₂₄ + 8e₃₄
0 - 8e₁ - 8e₂ + 8e₃
0 - 8e₁₄ - 8e₂₄ - 16e₃₄
0 + 16e₁ + 16e₂ - 16e₃
0 + 16e₁₄ + 16e₂₄ + 32e₃₄
```
Alternatively, if you do not wish to assign these variables to your local workspace, the `Grassmann.Algebra{N}` constructors can be used to contain them, which is exported to the user as the method `Λ(V)`,
```Julia
julia> G3 = Λ(3) # equivalent to Λ(V"+++")
Grassmann.Algebra{3,8}(+++, e, e₁, e₂, e₃, e₁₂, e₁₃, e₂₃, e₁₂₃)

julia> G3.e13 * G3.e12
e₂₃
```

This package is still a work in progress, and the API and implementation may change as more features and algebraic operations and product structure are added.
